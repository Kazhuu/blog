Ignition side of magneto is made of two coils in series. Looking at the front,
coil on the left side where green wire is connected measures ~138 ohms. The next
one on the right is connected to metal chassis of the magneto. Also white wire
is connected to this spot. The coil on the right measures ~150 ohms.

Ten smaller coils around the magneto are used for general voltage output and are
connected in series. These are connected to yellow and yellow/black wires of the
magneto. After the fix these measures around ~1 ohm.
